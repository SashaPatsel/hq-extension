## About
HQ is your HeadQuarters on your desktop. Once you sign up, you'll be signed in until you log out. Signing up lets HQ give you your local weather, allows you to pick your font, see the biggest headlines, and keep your own personal journal.

HQ is heavily inspired by [Momentum](https://momentumdash.com/).
